# React Bootstrap/Font Awesome starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See the default [cra-template README.md](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md) for some detailed quick start instructions.

The project includes [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react). It also includes some Google Font hosted fonts referenced in the public/index.html and src/index.scss files.
